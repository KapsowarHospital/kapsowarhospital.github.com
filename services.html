          <h2>Outpatient Department</h2>
            <p>The hospital's outpatient department is staffed five and a half days each week and is in operation at total of 306 days a year. All patients are screened for treatment and referred to one of the medical doctors for further evaluation, or direct admission to a ward if acutely ill. There is an average of around 58 visits per day. URI, malaria, and parasites continue to be the most common reasons for attending the OPD. </p>

      <h3>Eye Program</h3>
        <p>The eye program at Kapsowar is managed with the cooperation of other hospital staff and the communities of East Pokot, Baringo, and Kericho districts. </p>

      <h3>Hospital Pharmacy</h3>
        <p>The hospital pharmacy stocks and dispenses all drugs and medical supplies to the wards, theatre, and OPD. The majority of drugs stocked are those considered essential by the Ministry of Health of Kenya. </p>

          <h3>Theatre</h3>
          <p>A new theatre donated by Samaritan's Purse and sited adjacent to the Maternity Department was opened in the fall of 2011. The theatre has two operating rooms and is in operation seven days a week and does both major and minor surgeries. This includes surgeries for trauma and other surgical emergencies, orthopedic surgery, thyroidectomies, tonsillectomies, vagotomies, amputations, burns, reconstructive surgery for congenital and traumatic deformities, cleft lip and palette repairs, caesarean sections, and numerous other surgeries. </p>

      <h3>X-ray/Laboratory Departments</h3>
        <p>The hospital does have an x-ray department which commonly produces (in order of frequency) films of the chest, lower extremities, upper extremities, hip/pelvis, abdominal/GI, skull, and spine. The hospital laboratory performs many thousands of tests including malaria smears, hemoglobin determinations, stool examinations, and urinalysis. Biopsy specimens are sent out for microscopy to Kijabe Hospital, an AIC sister hospital in Kijabe, Kenya. Some of the most frequent pathological diagnoses are mulitnodular goiter, various types of carcinoma, benign prostatic hypertrophy, abscesses/inflammatory tissue, and lymph node tuberculosis. Fat necrosis or fibrotic tissue is a common finding in nodules of the skin, and Hodgkins is sometimes found. </p>

      <h3>Dental Care</h3>
        <p>Although the hospital has dental equipment available, a dentistry program is not yet in place. Still, theatre personnel perform around 200 extractions within a given year. </p>

      <h3>Pastoral Care</h3>
        <p>The hospital also has three chaplains who offer spiritual advice and pastoral care on the wards, as well as running the hospital chapel within the hospital grounds. Services are help on Wednesday mornings for staff from all departments to come together, and again on Sunday morning, for which both staff and patients are welcome to attend.</p>

      <h2>Training School</h2>
        <p>The hospital also partners with a nursing school, training students to be the next wave of nurses in Kenya.</p>
